# Crossed_Letters
1. To transform text from a text, word, pdf, or input text information and transform it into a Crossed Letter image or document (Here is some information on Crossed Letters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_letter). I want to have the first set of text run left to right, in blue, then rotate the document or image 90 degrees and print the text left to right in red. Having where the letters overlap turn purple. this way I can use blue light glasses to read one set of text and red glasses to read the other text. once the code creates this I want it to save the document in a image or document. whatever is easier. 
2. - import or take text - generate a document or image with the text like a standard letter format paper and if needed on multiple pages. - export the document 
3. Anyone that thinks it's cool. 
4. unknown currently so no limitation 
5. I want it to be simplistic and only able to review text inside a document. If there is complex headings or graphics, remove the graphics and put the words in a simplistic format like Obsidians text documents. https://help.obsidian.md/Home
